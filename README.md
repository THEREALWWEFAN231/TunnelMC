# TunnelMC

TunnelMC allows Minecraft Java Edition Players to join and play Minecraft Bedrock Edition servers.

# How does it work
Firstly, TunnelMC is a [Fabric Mod](https://fabricmc.net/). What we do is we open a connection to a Minecraft Bedrock server and translate any incoming and outgoing packets, so they can be read by both editions.

# Why a Fabric Mod and not a Proxy
Well, we love fabric ‚ù§Ô∏è. Also, making it a mod instead of a proxy allows us to do some stuff we normally could not do. Such as skins, we read the skins from the bedrock server instead of [Minecraft.net](https://minecraft.net/) this would not be possible without some sort of mod. Also *technically* we could add emotes and other stuff Minecraft Java Edition does not have. Granted we probably won't add emotes but we *could*.

# What is left to add
Yeah, well, that's not the correct question to ask, we just recently started development and the real question is what have we added.
- Offline server authentication(does not work with bedrock dedicated server, but does with Nukkit)
- Basic chunk translation
- Block translation(thanks to [Geysers' mappings](https://github.com/GeyserMC/mappings), still needs a little work, but it's generally there
- Spawning of players
- Skins(generally working, layers seem to not work)
- Chat
- Swinging animation

# Contributing
I'd like to help or try to help, where do I start? Setting up the project is just like any other [Fabric Mod](https://fabricmc.net/) for eclipse you need to run the gradlew genSources command, gradlew eclipse, then import it as an existing project into eclipse, if you're using another IDE please look at the [Fabric Wiki](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:setup).

Also it would be appreciated if you coded in this style
```java
if(x) {
  doSomething();
}
x.forEach(new Consumer<X>() {

  @Override
  public void accept(X x) {
    doSomething();
  }
});
```
rather then
```java
if(x)
  doSomething();
x.forEach((x) -> {
  doSomething();
});
```
Also if you have any knowledge on Xbox live/the api it would be cool if you added Xbox live authentication and/or joining worlds from invites.üòé

# Credits
This generally would not be possible without some open source projects, whether it's just looking at how a thing works to reverse translate them, looking at their code to see how things work, and or copying a little bit of their code. We appreciate all these projects.

# How can I try it
You currently can not, we are still in development and a lot has not been added yet.

# [Discord](https://discord.gg/qH6GqxW)
We might post some screenshots or information about TunnelMC in there, or if you'd like to help out, you can join and we can see what's crackin'.
